## Official Course Description (This Is Old)

**CMS 460 Algorithm Analysis**: Detailed study of algorithm design and analysis, including greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, backtracking, and branch and bound. Emphasis on verification and analysis of time space complexity. NP theory is introduced. Prerequisites: CMS 270 and MAT 140.

## What Will We Learn in This Class?

There's a perception that the field of computer science is
constantly changing, and in some respects that's true: there are
always new languages, frameworks, and application domain rising
up and old ones sinking down. Part of being a great computer
scientist is learning how to continually adapt yourself to new
ways of solving problems.

All of this change that we see around us, though, is like the top
part of an iceberg. The most visible elements of our field, like
languages and applications, are built upon and supported by a
deeper layer of knowledge that's mostly invisible to the casual
observer.

This course is about what's under the water, the fundamental
things that support all of the computer science, even if we don't
see them right away.

After completing this Algorithms course, you will have a deeper
understanding of many fundamental problem-solving strategies that
show up again and again throughout computer science. These 
include:

- Recursion
- Sorting algorithms
- Divide-and-conquer algorithms
- Fundamental data structures: trees and hash tables
- Graph algorithms and their applications

## Scrumage

### What?
This course will be different from other courses you've taken. We'll be using a new course management framework called **Scrumage** ("**Scrum** for **Ag**ile **E**ducation"), originally developed by Dr. Shannon Duvall at Elon University. Scrumage is based on the Scrum project management framework, which you may have used for team-based projects in some of your earlier courses.

### How Does It Work?
Here are the  main features of Scrumage:

1. The course is structured as a series of **sprints**, each lasting two weeks. Each sprint covers one unit of material. There will be seven sprints in our course.

2. At the beginning of each sprint, you'll be given a list of learning topics for the sprint, a curated list of resources (videos, readings, worked examples, etc.), and a set of required deliverables due at the end of the two-week period.

3. Working with a team, you'll have broad freedom to decide how to use the available resources to learn the required material and complete the sprint deliverables. You can decide on your own meeting schedule, what resources to use, and your own plan for finishing the projects. Scrumage gives you **options** and the freedom to determine your own best learning approach.

4. As your professor, I'll be in the room each day to meet with your teams, answer your questions, and check your work-in-progress. You can make an **expert request** to ask for a short lecture, worked example, or other help with a particular topic.

5. Each sprint ends with an individual quiz. You can receive bonus points if your entire team does well on the quiz or if your team as a whole improves.

6. You'll also have the opportunity to complete a short reflective exercise at the end of each sprint, which will help you understand your own learning process and make improvements before the next sprint.

Take a look at the `Scrumage.md` document for a detailed overview of the process.

### That Sounds Hard. Why Are We Doing This?
Scrumage is based on **student choice**, **flexibility**, and **reflection**.

In a traditional course, the professor is in charge of every aspect of the class. I get to decide what we learn, in what order, what readings or resoures we use, and how your learning will be assessed. If my choices don't work for you, well, that's tough.

In this class, you'll have **freedom** to take ownership of your own learning. You'll have the broad ability to make your own schedule, choose your own combination of resources (lectures, readings, videos, examples, etc.), and generally pick the best individualized strategies that help you master the course material.

Scrumage will let you **learn computer science concepts** by **working like a computer scientist**. Scrum is an industry-standard framework, so you'll be building facility with real software development techniques as you work through this course.

Finally, Scrumage supports **learning how to learn**, the **single most important skill you can acquire in college**. By taking ownership of your own learning, you'll be able to identify the resources, plans, and strategies that work best for you and build skills that you can take forward into other classes or your professional career.

## The All-Important Grading Section

### Assignments
Grading for this course will also be different from your previous classes.

We'll have five kinds of assignments in the class:

1. The short reflective pieces completed at the end of each sprint.
2. The team deliverables due at the end of each sprint.
3. The indvidual quizzes
4. Two major projects, due at the ends of sprints 5 and 7.
5. A take-home final exam.

### Grading
Rather than calculating your score as number of points on a 0-100 scale, your grade will be based on attaining **satisfactory** performance on each of these assignments.

I will grade most of the items you turn in on a two-level scale: your work will be either **satisfactory** or receive **no credit**. Satisfactory means:

1. Substantially complete and correct (there may be some issues, but only minor ones).
2. Shows real understanding and application of the course material
3. Completed on time in the required format.

I'll grade the quizzes on a scale from 0 to 3:

0. No submission, or too incomplete to grade.
1. Shows effort, but has issues.
2. Satisfactory.
3. Excellent, complete and correct with an attention to detail and insight that goes beyond satisfactory.

### Final Letter Grades

**To earn a B-**, you must meet the following six criteria:

1. Satisfactory completion of all reflective assignments and concept maps. You get to do these in class, so this one is easy.
2. Get an average of at least 2.0 on your top *N* - 1 indvidual quizzes, including any bonus points you earn.
3. Satisfactory work on *N* - 1 of the team sprint deliverables.
4. Satisfactory work on major project #1.
5. Satisfactory work on major project #2.
6. Satisfactory performance on the take-home final exam.

Complete five of the six criteria to receive a C. Complete four of the six to receive a D.

**To earn a higher grade**, you can complete additional work. I will adjust your final grade upwards by **one half of a letter grade** for each of the following:

1. Earn an average of at least 3.0 across all quizzes, including any bonus points you earn. This rewards you for sustained high performance on the individual quizzes.
2. Complete an individual challenge assignment. There will be at least two of these. This rewards you for exceptional individual engagement with the course material.
3. Completion of excellent work on a team-based major project. To receive credit for this, you must turn in an extra document that makes a **successful evidence-based case** that your team has gone beyond the satisfactory requirements for the project. Your write-up must include a description of how each team member contributed to make the poejct excellent. This rewards you for doing high-quality teamwork.
4. Completion of an in-depth reflective essay that draws upon your earlier reflections throughout the course. This rewards you for critically evaluating your own learning process.

### Why Are You Doing This To Us?

This style of grading is called **Specifications Grading** or **Contract Grading**. It has several advantages over the traditional 0-100 based points system:

1. Your grade is directly tied to the learning that you demonstrate in the course. The satisfactory work sets a baseline, but to earn a higher grade, you must either jump more hurdles or jump higher ones.

2. It gives you choices for how to attain higher grades. You can complete individual programming assignments, superior team work, or in-depth reflection.

3. It's relatively easy to get a B if you do the required work, but hard to get an A. This preserves the integrity of the course, while still making it possible for everyone to succeed.

4. If you only need a B or a C, you can adjust your effort accordingly: the standards are transparent. If you want a higher grade, you have an incentive to do more.

### What About My Partial Credit?

You may initially feel uncomfortable about everything being graded as satisfactory / no credit.
