I sometimes need to modify my schedule to account for meetings and other campus events.

## Official Course Description

**CMS 460 Algorithms**: Detailed study of algorithm design and analysis, including advanced data structures and algorithmic design paradigms. Emphasis on verification and analysis of time space complexity. NP theory is introduced. Prerequisites: CMS 270 and MAT 140.

## What Will We Learn in This Class?

There's a perception that the field of computer science is
constantly changing, and in some respects that's true: there are
always new languages, frameworks, and application domain rising
up and old ones sinking down. Part of being a great computer
scientist is learning how to continually adapt yourself to new
ways of solving problems.

All of this change that we see around us, though, is like the **top
part of an iceberg**. The most visible elements of our field, like
languages and applications, are built upon and supported by a
**deeper layer of knowledge** that's mostly invisible to the casual
observer.

This course is about what's under the water, **the fundamental
things that support all of the computer science**, even if we don't
see them right away.

After completing this Algorithms course, you will have a deeper
understanding of many fundamental problem-solving strategies that
show up again and again throughout computer science. These 
include:

- Recursion
- Sorting algorithms
- Divide-and-conquer algorithms
- Fundamental data structures: trees and hash tables
- Algorithmic strategies: greedy, backtracking, branch-and-bound, dynamic programming
- Graph algorithms and their applications

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course, you will have achieved the following learning outcomes:

1. Connect study of algorithms to other areas of computer science.

2. Understand and apply ideas of complexity and efficiency.

3. Develop "algorithmic intuition" -- familiarity with common moves and techniques.

4. Develop research skills to learn about new algorithms and data structures.

5. Be able to talk about algorithm choices intelligently.

## Scrumage

### What?
This course will be different from other courses you've taken. We'll be using a new course management framework called **Scrumage** ("**Scrum** for **Ag**ile **E**ducation"), originally developed by Dr. Shannon Duvall at Elon University. Scrumage is based on the Scrum project management framework, which you may have used for team-based projects in some of your earlier courses.

### How Does It Work?
Here are the  main features of Scrumage:

1. The course is structured as a series of **sprints**, each lasting two weeks. Each sprint covers one unit of material. There will be seven sprints in our course.

2. At the beginning of each sprint, you'll be given a list of learning topics for the sprint, a curated list of resources (videos, readings, worked examples, etc.), and a set of required deliverables due at the end of the two-week period.

3. Working with a team, you'll have broad freedom to decide how to use the available resources to learn the required material and complete the sprint deliverables. You can decide on your own meeting schedule, what resources to use, and your own plan for finishing the projects. Scrumage gives you **options** and the freedom to determine your own best learning approach.

4. As your professor, I'll be in the room each day to meet with your teams, answer your questions, and check your work-in-progress. You can make an **expert request** to ask for a short lecture, worked example, or other help with a particular topic.

5. Each sprint ends with an individual quiz. You can receive bonus points if your entire team does well on the quiz or if your team as a whole improves.

6. You'll also have the opportunity to complete a short reflective exercise at the end of each sprint, which will help you understand your own learning process and make improvements before the next sprint.

Take a look at the `Scrumage.md` document for a detailed overview of the process.

### That Sounds Hard. Why Are We Doing This?
Scrumage is based on **student choice**, **flexibility**, and **reflection**.

In a traditional course, the professor is in charge of every aspect of the class. I get to decide what we learn, in what order, what readings or resoures we use, and how your learning will be assessed. If my choices don't work for you, well, that's tough.

In this class, you'll have **freedom** to take ownership of your own learning. You'll have the broad ability to make your own schedule, choose your own combination of resources (lectures, readings, videos, examples, etc.), and generally pick the best individualized strategies that help you master the course material.

Scrumage will let you **learn computer science concepts** by **working like a computer scientist**. Scrum is an industry-standard framework, so you'll be building facility with real software development techniques as you work through this course.

Finally, Scrumage supports **learning how to learn**, the **single most important skill you can acquire in college**. By taking ownership of your own learning, you'll be able to identify the resources, plans, and strategies that work best for you and build skills that you can take forward into other classes or your professional career.

## The All-Important Grading Section

### Specs Grading
Grading for this course will also be different from your previous classes.

Rather than calculating your score as number of points on a 0-100 scale, your grade will be based on attaining **satisfactory** performance on a bundle of assignments. This approach is called **Specifications Grading** or **Contract Grading** and it has several advantages over the traditional 0-100 based points system.

If you achieve satisfactory performance on enough assigments, described in more detail below, you'll receive a baseline grade of **B-** for the course. This demonstrates that you have engaged with the material and met the basic learning outcomes for the class. To get a higher grade, you can do more work that shows greater mastery of the course learning outcomes.

### Assignments and Scoring
We'll have five kinds of assignments in the class:

1. Short reflective pieces completed at the end of each sprint.
2. Team deliverables due at the end of each sprint.
3. Indvidual quizzes
4. Two major projects, due at the ends of sprints 5 and 7.
5. A take-home final exam.

I will grade most of the items you turn in on a two-level scale: your work will be either **satisfactory** or receive **no credit**. 
A "satisfactory" assignment corresponds to a B-level performance, which is **a higher standard** than we often associate with that term. It means that the work is:

1. Substantially complete and correct (there may be a few issues, but only minor ones).
2. Shows real understanding and application of the course material.
3. Completed on time in the required format.

I'll grade the quizzes on a scale from 0 to 3:

0. No submission, or too incomplete to grade.
1. Shows effort, but has serious issues.
2. Satisfactory.
3. Excellent, complete and correct with an attention to detail and insight that goes beyond satisfactory.

You can earn a **bonus point** on a quiz if either:

1. Every member of your team earns a 2 or 3.
2. You improve your individual performance relative to the last quiz.

### Final Letter Grades

**To earn a B**, you must meet the following six criteria:

1. Satisfactory completion of all reflective assignments and concept maps.
2. Get an average of at least 2.0 on your top *N* - 1 indvidual quizzes, including any bonus points you earn.
3. Satisfactory work on *N* - 1 of the team sprint deliverables.
4. Satisfactory work on major project #1.
5. Satisfactory work on major project #2.
6. Satisfactory performance on the final exam.

**If you fail to complete the requirements for a B**, your grade will be adjusted downwards according to the following table:


| For unsatisfactory performance on | Your grade will be adjusted downwards by |
| -------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| One quiz beyond the one you're allowed to drop | Half a letter grade |
| Additional quizzes          | A full letter grade |
| One team deliverable            | Half a letter grade |
| Additional team deliverables            | A full letter grade |
| A major project            | A full letter grade |
| The final exam            | A full letter grade |
| The reflective assignments            | A full letter grade |
| Failure to submit an assignment | Double the penalty for an unsatisfactory submission |

These penalties are cumulative. For example, if you fail to achieve satisfactory performance on two quizzes (beyond the one you're allowed drop), you base grade would be lowered by 1.5 letters, from B to C-.

**To earn a higher grade**, you can complete additional work. I will adjust your final grade upwards by **one half of a letter grade** for each of the following:

1. Earn an average of at least 3.0 across all quizzes, including any bonus points you earn. This rewards you for sustained high performance on the individual quizzes.

2. Complete an individual challenge assignment. There will be at least two of these. This rewards you for exceptional individual engagement with the course material.

3. Completion of excellent work on a team-based major project. To receive credit for this, you must turn in an extra document that makes a **successful evidence-based case** that your team has gone beyond the satisfactory requirements for the project. Your write-up must include a description of how each team member contributed to make the project excellent. This rewards you for doing high-quality teamwork.

4. Completion of an in-depth reflective essay that draws upon your earlier reflections throughout the course. This rewards you for critically evaluating your own learning process.

### Why Are You Doing This To Us?

1. In a traditional system, your grade is ultimately determined by my judgment of your work. My judgment is pretty good, but specs grading gives you more clarity about where you stand and guidance for how to achieve the grade you want

2. Your grade is directly tied to the learning that you demonstrate. The satisfactory work sets a baseline, but to earn a higher grade, you must either jump more hurdles or jump higher ones.

3. It gives you choices for how to attain higher grades. You can boost your grade by completing individual programming assignments, superior team-based projects, or an in-depth reflection.

4. It's relatively easy to get a B if you do the required work, but hard to get an A. This preserves the integrity of the course, while still making it possible for everyone to succeed.

5. If you only need a B or a C, you can adjust your effort accordingly: the standards are transparent. You don't have to spend time on the most difficult assignments if you don't need them to get the result you want.

6. It reflects how you'll be evaluated in your career. Work assignments aren't graded out of 100% and your boss won't give partial credit for incomplete work.

### What About My Partial Credit?

You may feel uncomfortable about the two-level grading scale. This will pass.

1. Two-level grading is faster, so I will be able to return work more quickly and put more effort into giving you meaningful feedback.

2. Two-level grading is more consistent. It's easier to sort work into two bins, rather than slicing it into 100 possible points.

3. Each project will have a spec that clearly explains the requirements for satisfactory work. You can also ask me (through the expert request form) for an evaluation of your work-in-progress.

4. Again, industry doesn't give partial credit. If you're asked to code a feature or prepare a presentation, you're ultimately going to be evaluated on a pass / fail basis.

5. There are six ways to increase your grade. You only need four of them to move from the satisfactory B- to an A.

## Course Policies

**Attendance** The only way to be consistently successful in your academic ca- reer is to regularly attend class meetings and participate in in-class activities. Therefore, while I do not mandate attendance at every single class, I expect full attendance every time we meet.

**Laptops** If you have a laptop, please bring it to class.

**Phones** Unlike laptops, I see few advantages to using phones during class. Please silence your phones at the beginning of class. Holding text conversations during class is both distracting and disrespectful and will not be tolerated.

**Late Submissions** Assignments are due on the stated day at the stated time. Speak to me in well in advance of the due date if you need an extension.

**Please speak to me if there are any issues making it difficult for you to succeed in class**. We can always work out a plan to deal with illness, work, or family responsibilities.

**Recording** No audio or video recording is permitted without prior permission.

**Canvas and GitHub** Most of the course material will be distributed through GitHub. We'll use Canvas to keep track of grades, announcements, and a few other things.

## Necessary and Proper Clause

As your course facilitator, I will make every effort to adhere to the topics and schedule described in this syllabus. However, I reserve the right to make changes for the good of the course.


## Honor Code
Membership in the student body of Rollins College carries with it an obligation, and requires a commitment, to act with honor in all things. The student commitment to uphold the values of honor - honesty, trust, respect, fairness, and responsibility - particularly manifests itself in two public aspects of student life. First, as part of the admission process to the College, students agree to com- mit themselves to the Honor Code. Then, as part of the matriculation process during Orientation, students sign a more detailed pledge to uphold the Honor Code and to conduct themselves honorably in all their activities, both academic and social, as a Rollins student. A student signature on the following pledge is a binding commitment by the student that lasts for his or her entire tenure at Rollins College:

> The development of the virtues of Honor and Integrity are integral to a Rollins College education and to membership in the Rollins College community. Therefore, I, a student of Rollins College, pledge to show my commitment to these virtues by abstaining from any lying, cheating, or plagiarism in my academic endeavors and by behaving responsibly, respectfully and honorably in my social life and in my relationships with others. This pledge is reinforced every time a student submits work for academic credit as his/her own. Students shall add to the paper, quiz, test, lab report, etc., the handwritten signed statement:
>
> **“On my honor, I have not given, nor received, nor witnessed any unauthorized assistance on this work.”**
>

Material submitted electronically should contain the pledge; submission implies signing the pledge.

## How Do I Interpret the Honor Code?
In the context of this class, my interpretation of the Honor Code pledge is that the work you submit for every assignment shall be your own original creation. This means that any item you submit must be written by you and you alone, or in an assigned group project by your group alone. Copying a complete solution from fellow class members, previous class members, books, or the Internet is a violation of this policy and will constitute academic misconduct.
