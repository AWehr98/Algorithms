Meeting with students is my highest priority during these times. Feel free to come by **even if you don't have a question or a problem**.
I sometimes need to modify my schedule to account for meetings and other campus events.

## Official Course Description

**CMS 460 Algorithm Analysis**: Detailed study of algorithm design and analysis, including greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, backtracking, and branch and bound. Emphasis on verification and analysis of time space complexity. NP theory is introduced. Prerequisites: CMS 270 and MAT 140.

## What Will We Learn in This Class?

There's a perception that the field of computer science is
constantly changing, and in some respects that's true: there are
always new languages, frameworks, and application domain rising
up and old ones sinking down. Part of being a great computer
scientist is learning how to continually adapt yourself to new
ways of solving problems.

All of this change that we see around us, though, is like the top
part of an iceberg. The most visible elements of our field, like
languages and applications, are built upon and supported by a
deeper layer of knowledge that's mostly invisible to the casual
observer.

This course is about what's under the water, the fundamental
things that support all of the computer science, even if we don't
see them right away.

After completing this Algorithms course, you will have a deeper
understanding of many fundamental problem-solving strategies that
show up again and again throughout computer science. These 
include:

- Recursion
- Sorting algorithms
- Divide-and-conquer algorithms
- Fundamental data structures: trees and hash tables
- Graph algorithms and their applications
