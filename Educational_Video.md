# Sprint 5: Research and Educational Videos

## Description

In this sprint, your team will work together to research an **algorithmic strategy**, then prepare an **educational video** to teach it to the rest of the class.

We've already seen one general algorithmic strategy: divide-and-conquer, which worked by splitting a large problem into smaller sub-problems. By itself, divide-and-conquer isn't really an *algorithm*, it's more like a **general technique for building algorithms**. If you want to be fancy (which of course you do), you could call it an **algorithm design paradigm**.

I will assign each team one of the following strategies to research:

1. Greedy algorithms
2. Backtracking search
3. Dynamic programming
4. Branch and bound

## Why Are We Doing This?

## Deliverables

Your team will produce a **10 minute** video introducing and explaining your assigned algorithmic strategy. You can use any technology or tool to make the video, but make sure it's something that you can export and upload to YouTube for others to view.

Your video should address the following points:

1. Give a short description of the basic idea of your strategy. If you had to sum it up in one or two sentences, what would you say?

2. What kind of problems does this strategy help you solve? Where are you most likely to see it? What connections (if any) does it have to other methods that we've already talked about in the class?

3. Give a high-level example, presenting the intuitive idea of the method in the context of a simple problem.

4. Work through a more detailed example showing a characteristic application of the strategy.

You'll also need to submit a **three-question quiz** covering the material in your video. Other students should be able to answer the quiz questions after watching your video.

As you're developing your video, use the following methodology:

1. Think about the high-level **learning outcomes** you want someone watching your video to achieve. What should they know after seeing your work? Remember, 10 minutes is not a lot of time, so you'll probably have only one or two major points that you can get across. What should these be? What is the **essence** of your algorithmic strategy?

2. Write your quiz. Your questions should be tied directly to the learning outcomes you set in question 1. In other words, if someone can answer your quiz questions, you'd feel confident that they learned what you wanted them to learn.

3. Design your video to supply answers to the quiz questions, or to teach the skills someone would need to answer the questions.

**Interesting Question**: does this process give you insight into the relationship between course content, assignments, and learning outcomes?

## Specifications

You've watched videos throughout the class. What makes for a good one?

To receive credit, your video must:

- Be between 9 and 11 minutes long.
- Be shown at the in-class film festival on April 8.
- **BE INTERESTING**. You get no credit if I die of boredom during your video.
- Incorporate visuals that illustrate key concepts.
- Answer the four key points given in the previous section: intuitive description, typical applications (why do you need this?), high-level example, more detailed example.
- Have a written set of **key learning outcomes** that someone watching your video should be able to take away.
- Have a three-question quiz that demonstrates proficiency of your learning outcomes.
- Design your video to supply answers or teach skills relevant to the questions on your quiz.

## Suggested Timeline

**March 30**

- Beginning of sprint.
- Figure out the basic idea of your algorithmic strategy and investigate worked examples.
